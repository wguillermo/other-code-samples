                    <p class="para">Dave Kama has been a student of Jiu Jitsu since the mid 1980s. He was fortunate enough to begin his journey learning at the "Gracie Garage" in Torrance, CA. Dave is one of the very few people to have trained under Grandmaster Rickson, and have all his belts - blue to black awarded to him by the legendary Grandmaster. Dave Kama is also #2 of the "Dirty Dozen", a moniker given to the first 12 non-Brazilians to earn the coveted black belt. Dave received his black belt in 1995. Prior to that, in 1993, Grandmaster Rickson asked Dave to take over as head instructor at the Rickson Gracie Laguna Niguel location. Dave has been running that location ever since. In 2012, upon Grandmaster Rickson's retirement, Professor Dave officially changed the name of the school from Rickson Gracie Laguna Niguel to Kama Jiu-Jitsu, part of the Rickson Gracie Team.</p>
